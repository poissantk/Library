# Library

Library is a project focused on demonstrating skills in Python software engineering. This project involved creating classes in python that use inheritance, interact with other classes, and utilize encapsulation. I also practiced overriding magic methods such as __str__ and creating with classes with getters and setters using @property and @variable.setter. I also incorporated design patters such as creating a decorator function to act as a timer and a factory function to easily create different items. Finally, I created a test class to perform unit tests on my project.
